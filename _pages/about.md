I work as a software engineer at MegVII, a start-up computer vision company in China. Iâ€™m interested in libraries and infrastructure for computer vision and deep learning.

One of my famous work is [YOLOX](https://github.com/Megvii-BaseDetection/YOLOX), an anchor-free YOLO for object detection task. I re-design the whole library and make the code simpler and faster before public release.
I'm also a mantainer of [cvpods](https://github.com/Megvii-BaseDetection/cvpods), an all-in-one tool box for computer vision based on dectron2. I also create a [megengine](https://github.com/MegEngine/MegEngine) based classification/detection framework named [basecls](https://github.com/megvii-research/basecls) and [basedet](https://github.com/megvii-research/basedet). basecls and basedet help MegVII to generate more models for production purpose.

Please feel free to reach out if you want to discuss any questions. I would also like to hear your feedback so I can learn and grow.
